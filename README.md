# COVID-CT

## (The negative CT images have been added to repo ''Images-processed'' and we will provide a Meta datafile soon.)

**UPDATE**: We start to include images from LANCET, JAMA, BMJ and NEJM. 66 new COVID-19 CTs were added into COVID-CT-Images.zip

The COVID-CT-Dataset has 358 CT images containing clinical findings of COVID-19. We are continuously adding more COVID CTs.

The images are collected from medRxiv and bioRxiv papers about COVID-19. CTs containing COVID-19 abnormalities are selected by reading the figure captions in the papers. All copyrights of the data belong to medRxiv and bioRxiv.
