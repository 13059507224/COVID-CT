# COVID-CT


**We are continuously adding new COVID CT images and we would like to invite the community to contribute COVID CTs as well.**

The COVID-CT-Dataset has 357 CT images containing clinical findings of COVID-19. They are in ./Images-processed/CT_COVID.zip  Non-COVID CT scans are in ./Images-processed/CT_NonCOVID.zip

We provide a data split in ./Data-split

The meta information (e.g., patient ID, image caption) is in COVID-CT-MetaInfo.xlsx


The images are collected from COVID19-related papers from medRxiv, bioRxiv, NEJM, JAMA, Lancet, etc. CTs containing COVID-19 abnormalities are selected by reading the figure captions in the papers. All copyrights of the data belong to the authors and publishers of these papers.
